# Project52 Ruby Challenge

A project to write a small project everyweek. All projects are written by Ruby.


## Preface:

I saw [kkdai](https://github.com/kkdai/project52) sharing a slide [reflectionsfrom 52 weeks 52 projects](https://speakerdeck.com/jeffersonlam/reflections-from-52-weeks-52-projects) and felt inspired. So, I hope I could learn something by doing the same challenge myself.

## Constraint:

Here are the constraints of Project52.

- The project could be small or big, but it should be something new not just refactoring an old project.
- The Programming language is not limited, feel free to write any language you have  just learnt. (actually I am interested in writing some R packages, just because I want to learn it.)
- Don't need to create brand new project, you could rewrite some exist project. (but on your own way, not allow to fork and refine.)
